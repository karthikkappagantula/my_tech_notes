# Agile Foundations<a name="agile-foundations"></a>
Organizations were also figuring out that heavier project management methodologies, which focused more on long-term planning, were not as effective for the types of projects they were working on now. Due to a highly changing environment and constant demands to stay current on innovative technologies, it was imperative to find newer and better ways of doing things.

## THE AGILE ALLIANCE<a name="agile_alliance"></a>
* The ability to build working software quickly by understanding what the customer needs with very little front-end planning and documentation formed a large part of the discussions.
* The Agile Alliance determined that new methods should be based on iterative and incremental development rather than a preplanned and well-defined scope of work right at the very beginning of the project. This would allow the result to surface organically as new features or requirements were discovered.
* The second driving factor was creating higher quality software in shorter time frames, running short sprints or iterations and work to produce something usable at the end of each.
* It was necessary to have requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and self-organizing, cross-functional teams. This would allow for business value to evolve and develop a cross-pollinated understanding of what the results should be at the team level. Everyone knows the vision, even when the vision changes.
