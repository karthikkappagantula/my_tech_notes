# Agile Foundations<a name="agile-foundations"></a>
Organizations were also figuring out that heavier project management methodologies, which focused more on long-term planning, were not as effective for the types of projects they were working on now. Due to a highly changing environment and constant demands to stay current on innovative technologies, it was imperative to find newer and better ways of doing things.

## Agile Alliance<a name="agile_alliance"></a>
* The ability to build working software quickly by understanding what the customer needs with very little front-end planning and documentation formed a large part of the discussions.
* The Agile Alliance determined that new methods should be based on iterative and incremental development rather than a preplanned and well-defined scope of work right at the very beginning of the project. This would allow the result to surface organically as new features or requirements were discovered.
* The second driving factor was creating higher quality software in shorter time frames, running short sprints or iterations and work to produce something usable at the end of each.
* It was necessary to have requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and self-organizing, cross-functional teams. This would allow for business value to evolve and develop a cross-pollinated understanding of what the results should be at the team level. Everyone knows the vision, even when the vision changes.

## Agile Manifesto<a name="agile_manifesto"></a>
* The Agile Manifesto was designed to be a set of lightweight and guiding principles rather than set rules and formal processes.
* The Agile Manifesto forms the basis for most methods currently in use today, including Scrum, eXtreme Programming, Lean, Crystal Methods, and others.
* The Agile Manifesto does not suggest that we do one over the other; rather, it advocates that while all of the mentioned items are important, some are valued more than the others.

### Manifesto Principles:<br>
**Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools**<br>
 * This isn’t a suggestion that process and tools are unnecessary; rather, it’s more that there is better value found in individuals and interactions.<br>
**Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation**<br>
 * It is more important to have software that works and that meets business value and tech specs than it is to spend time putting together massive plans that will change.<br>
**Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation**<br>
 * Collaboration with the customer and working toward the right solution is more important than locking down a contract that doesn’t meet the needs of the customer in the end. <br>
**Responding to Change over Following a Plan** <br>
 * The ability to pivot and be agile is the crux of all methods and frameworks. Change happens—it’s expected and embraced.<br>
 
#### 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
