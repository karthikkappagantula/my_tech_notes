# Agile Foundations<a name="agile-foundations"></a>

Organizations were also figuring out that heavier project management methodologies, which focused more on long-term planning, were not as effective for the types of projects they were working on now. Due to a highly changing environment and constant demands to stay current on innovative technologies, it was imperative to find newer and better ways of doing things.

## Agile Alliance<a name="agile_alliance"></a>

* The ability to build working software quickly by understanding what the customer needs with very little front-end planning and documentation formed a large part of the discussions.
* The Agile Alliance determined that new methods should be based on iterative and incremental development rather than a preplanned and well-defined scope of work right at the very beginning of the project. This would allow the result to surface organically as new features or requirements were discovered.
* The second driving factor was creating higher quality software in shorter time frames, running short sprints or iterations and work to produce something usable at the end of each.
* It was necessary to have requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration and self-organizing, cross-functional teams. This would allow for business value to evolve and develop a cross-pollinated understanding of what the results should be at the team level. Everyone knows the vision, even when the vision changes.

## Agile Manifesto<a name="agile_manifesto"></a>

* The Agile Manifesto was designed to be a set of lightweight and guiding principles rather than set rules and formal processes.
* The Agile Manifesto forms the basis for most methods currently in use today, including Scrum, eXtreme Programming, Lean, Crystal Methods, and others.
* The Agile Manifesto does not suggest that we do one over the other; rather, it advocates that while all of the mentioned items are important, some are valued more than the others.

### Manifesto Principles:<br>

* **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools**<br>
This isn’t a suggestion that process and tools are unnecessary; rather, it’s more that there is better value found in individuals and interactions.<br>
* **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation**<br>
It is more important to have software that works and that meets business value and tech specs than it is to spend time putting together massive plans that will change.<br>
* **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation**<br>
Collaboration with the customer and working toward the right solution is more important than locking down a contract that doesn’t meet the needs of the customer in the end. <br>
* **Responding to Change over Following a Plan** <br>
The ability to pivot and be agile is the crux of all methods and frameworks. Change happens—it’s expected and embraced.<br>
 
### 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective and then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### 12 Principles of Agile Manifesto Simplified

1. **Customer Satisfaction**: All Agile methodologies are looking for ways to bring value to the customer on a regular basis by communicating and adapting to changing customer needs.
2. **Welcome Changes**: This keeps the team on top of new requirements and allows for some flexibility in the design rather than preplan and go through a formal change control system every time there is an update to the scope of work.
3. **Frequent Delivery**: Like many methodologies and frameworks that deal with short iterations, the goal is to produce something usable early and often. Frequent delivery is about producing a usable increment in a short time span that the customer finds valuable.
4. **Collocated Teams**: Many best practices in Agile project management have collocated teams. If team members are located remotely or are virtual, the best practice is to collocate them for at least one iteration if possible.
5. **Motivated Individuals**: Teams are self-managed and self-organizing, and they are there because they want to be there. Demotivation doesn’t produce good working increments or keep the team focused on providing value.
6. **Face to Face Contact**: Communication is a large part of Agile project management, and face-to-face contact is the best way to communicate. It ties into collocation as well as open and honest communication across the team dynamic.
7. **Working Software**: Focus is on a usable increment that works, and not spending a lot of time on creating software that doesn’t work. This is done by getting frequent feedback, utilizing frequent testing and reviews, and looking back to see what changes for the better are necessary.
8. **Constant/Sustainable Pace**: Try to achieve a 40-hour work week and no overtime if possible.
9. **Continuous Attention**: The entire team looks for ways to improve quality, the design, and the overall process on a regular basis.
10. **Simplicity**: Keep it simple. Don’t add extra features that are unnecessary.
11. **Self-Organization**: The team decides for itself what it can and can’t do, and it works together on solutions.
12. **Regular Reflection**: The team keeps a constant focus on looking back to move forward more successfully.

### The declaration of interdependence
The concept behind the Declaration of Interdependence was to develop modern management principles essential to project management and management in general. <br>

The six principles are based on what might be required to achieve the mindset of an Agile-type project, regardless of the industry.<br>

**Agile and adaptive approaches for linking people, projects, and value. We are a community of project leaders that are highly successful at delivering results.**

To achieve these results:
1.We increase return on investment by making continuous flow of value our focus.
2.We deliver reliable results by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership.
3.We expect uncertainty and manage for it through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation.
4.We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of value and creating an environment where they can make a difference.
5.We boost performance through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.
6.We improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices.

### The declaration of interdependence simplified

1. **We increase return on investment by making continuous flow of value our focus.** <br>
	The goal is to produce something of value by collecting requirements as current information is gathered. Requirements are collected on a continuous basis, with quick turn-around of results so that value is returned and ROI is achieved.
2. **We deliver reliable results by engaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership.** <br>
	The results are dependent on interacting with the customers on a regular basis to find out what is new, what has changed, and what they find valuable today. The customer is part of owning the result and therefore is more invested in how they communicate and interact.
3. **We expect uncertainty and manage for it through iterations, anticipation, and adaptation.** <br>
	By carrying the expectation that we don’t have an if situation but instead a when situation, we can adapt and pivot as needed.
4. **We unleash creativity and innovation by recognizing that individuals are the ultimate source of value and creating an environment where they can make a difference.** <br>
5. **We boost performance through group accountability for results and shared responsibility for team effectiveness.** <br>
	Agile world is more equal in the distribution of the work, the accountability, and the glory. It is a shift in focus to a team dynamic rather than a top-down hierarchy.
6. **We improve effectiveness and reliability through situationally specific strategies, processes, and practices.** <br>
	What works for one project will not work for another. Knowing this leaves a more fluid focus on solutions rather than on rules, and with that comes ROI, reliable results, managed risk, creativity, and boosted performance.

*It is typical to adopt the defined (theoretical) modeling approach when the underlying mechanisms by which a process operates are reasonably well understood. When the process is too complicated for the defined approach, the empirical approach is the appropriate choice.*

### Empirical Process Control

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland are the creators of the Scrum methodology. They adapted and used empirical process control to develop the best practices of Scrum along with the Agile Manifesto as the guiding principle. The three key aspects of empirical process control are also the three pillars of Scrum.

Empirical process controls focus on the following:

* **Transparency**: This encompasses not just the process itself but all communications.
* **Inspection**: Frequent inspection and the utilization of frequent reviews of the product service or results is essential.
* **Adaptation**: None of the above will work fully without adaptation, which is the ability to embrace uncertainty and changes and manage risks accordingly.

*definition of empirical (using your own experiences and knowledge rather than buying into a set of processes based on theory or even known logic at the time)*

Empiricism involves learning and adapting as needed.
* * * 
The following are great guiding principles to know that get you into the mindset of empirical process control:

* Iterative
* Incremental
* Frequent reviews
* Adaptation
* Uncertainty and risks during execution
* It isn’t a “defined” process; it’s a way of being and doing

Agile, as a term, is the umbrella over all of the different methodologies that you can absorb, use, and understand. To pass the PMI-ACP exam, you have got to get into that frame of mind. The Agile principles mindset involves the following:

* Exploring, embracing, and applying Agile principles while incorporating that mindset across the team and the organization
* Focusing value driven delivery on high-value increments and making sure that they are produced early and often
* Meeting and reviewing stakeholder priorities
* Gaining feedback on the increments you produce and then prioritizing and improving upon them

### Satir Model

The Satir model, created by Virginia Satir during her work as a family counselor, correctly depicts how organizations go from the status quo to the introduction of a foreign element and then resist the changes. Once resistance begins, chaos ensues. Most organizations throw away the best practices of Agile because of the chaos instead of realizing that chaos is necessary for the transformation of ideas and the integration of those innovative ideas in order to move forward to a new status quo.

### Organizational agility tips

To implement Agile methodologies successfully, your organization will need to do the following:

* If your team or organization is new to Agile, it is best to use a proven method of best practices and then to try to create a hybrid approach.
* Implement Agile on the organizational level starting with an understanding and internalization of Agile principles.
* Practice the steps of a chosen Agile methodology until proficient.
* Encourage others to internalize and practice Agile.
* Learn the techniques before throwing a methodology out as not working.
* Embrace the higher criticality and weight of method based on team size and project length.
