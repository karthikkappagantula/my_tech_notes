# AWS Accounts and AWS Organizations

## AWS Organization
* Is a service that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts in to a single organization - a master account/root container.
* This makes billing and permissions easier and allows for the creation of managed accounts. 
* Can be further split in to Organization units(OU) which contains accounts - like one OU for each business unit.
* Can be operated in either 'Consolidated Billing' or 'All Features' mode.
