## Data Preprocessing

### Importing Libraries

* For Python - import below libraries.
  ```
  # importing the libraries
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import pandas as pd
  ```
* For R - Does not need any special libraries.

### Importing Dataset

**Before importing dataset, you have to set the current working directory in Spyder/Rstudio**
* For Python
  * Use pandas to import the dataset. Pandas creates a Dataframe with imported data.
  * Create the matrix of features/independent variables.
  * Create the vector for dependent variable.
  

```
# importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')
