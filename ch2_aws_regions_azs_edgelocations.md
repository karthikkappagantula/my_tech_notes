## Regions / macro scale isolation
There are many global regions. Usually > 100s of KM apart. 
Example - us-east-1, eu-central-1 etc

## Availability Zones / Fault isolation domains
Each region has multiple AZs. AZ names follow similar format as regions, but end with a letter.
Example - us-east-1a, us-east-1b, us-east-1c, us-east-1d etc.

Each AZ is usually one or more physical datacenters with the region. 
They are far enough that they are not impacted by local events. They are close enough to support high performance networking between these AZs, and fault isolation.

## Edge Infrastructure
Smaller pockets of infrastructure distributed globally accross major cities. AWS selects major data centers in those major urban areas and put in an edge location.
Usually contains storage and content distribution functionality. This also provides edge based compute capability that usually allow with certain services such as CloudFront, abillity to distribute or cache content at the edge to improve user experience
Cannot be used to deploy a EC2/RDS instances. 

### Usual practices
* For high performance and fault isolation, usually AZs can used.
* For global high availability. Example - Netflix. Usually costs high.

### Differences between High availability, Fault Tolerance, and Disaster Recovery
* High availability
